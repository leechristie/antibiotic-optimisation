Note that due to low sample size sampling error, some points which appear Pareto-optimal in the origonal data are actually not part of the Pareto front when re-sampled.\n","\n","The Pareto fronts will be combined and a new, single Pareto front computed from each experiment. Any non--Pareto-optimal points in the dataframes are not plotted. This means that far fewer points (~300) will be plotted than are present in the dataframes (~6000).\n","\n","Note that if not using re-evaluation data, there is a flag in the script to ignore re-evaluation and only plot the origonal evaluations. this is not recommended as it will cause candidate solutions to appear to have a lower failure rate."]},{"metadata":{"id":"uJTZCv68Lb6Q","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function\n","\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"xyqf5VeEIBfu","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Here we configure the relative path and filename information for the data to be processed."]},{"metadata":{"id":"2BpecbfTIcmv","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["DATA_PATH = \"/content/antibiotic\"\n","USING_REEVAL = True\n","FAILURE_RATE_COL = \"failurerate_reeval\" if USING_REEVAL else \"failurerate\"\n","EXPERIMENTS = ({\"title\" : \"Total Antibiotic vs Failure Rate\",\n","                \"series\" : (\"totalantibiotic-unconstrained.pkl\",\n","                            \"totalantibiotic-constrained.pkl\"),\n","                \"objectives\" : (FAILURE_RATE_COL,\n","                                \"totalantibiotic\")\n","               },\n","               {\"title\" : \"Maximum Concentration vs Failure Rate\",\n","                \"series\" : (\"maximumconcentration-unconstrained.pkl\",\n","                            \"maximumconcentration-constrained.pkl\"),\n","                \"objectives\" : (FAILURE_RATE_COL,\n","                                \"maximumconcentration\")\n","               }\n","              )\n","\n","CONSTRAINED_LIMIT = 0.01 # In the range [0.0, 1.0]\n","MAX_FAILURE_RATES = (None, CONSTRAINED_LIMIT)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"Q_En3NyZoeoX","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["This section loads the Pandas dataframes from the Pickle (`pkl`) files.\n","\n","The first few rows of the data from the objectives columns is printed.
